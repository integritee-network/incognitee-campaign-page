    <h1>Private Swaps</h1>
    <p>COMING SOON(TM)</p>
    <p>
      Whenever you use a centralized exchange (CEX), you trust them to operate a
      fair market and protect your data. Even worse, you hand over custody over
      your assets to them. The upside is: fast trading and something like
      privacy (in the best case your exposing your data and behavior to one
      entity only, not to the public)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need more autonomy, you may want to use decentralized exchanges
      (DEX). There, you keep custody over your assets and no single entity has
      the power to deny you access to the trading platform. However, this
      freedom comes with downsides: High latency and front-running
    </p>
    <p>
      Incognitee can support shielding of various digital assets and offer
      automated market makers (AMM, similar to uniswap) on L2. This will prevent
      front-running because no one can see the transactions before they are
      executed. It also offers enhanced speed because of subsecond block times
      on Incognitee
